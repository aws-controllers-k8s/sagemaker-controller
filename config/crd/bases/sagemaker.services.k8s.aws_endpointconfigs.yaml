                  Service key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data on the storage
                  volume attached to the ML compute instance that hosts the endpoint.
                  \n The KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats: \n    * Key
                  ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \n    * Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                  \n    * Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias \n    * Alias name ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias
                  \n The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that
                  you specify in your CreateEndpoint, UpdateEndpoint requests. For
                  more information, refer to the AWS Key Management Service section
                  Using Key Policies in AWS KMS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html)
                  \n Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage, dependent
                  on the instance type. Local storage volumes are encrypted using
                  a hardware module on the instance. You can't request a KmsKeyId
                  when using an instance type with local storage. If any of the models
                  that you specify in the ProductionVariants parameter use nitro-based
                  instances with local storage, do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId
                  parameter. If you specify a value for KmsKeyId when using any nitro-based
                  instances with local storage, the call to CreateEndpointConfig fails.
                  \n For a list of instance types that support local instance storage,
                  see Instance Store Volumes (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes).
                  \n For more information about local instance storage encryption,
